                            I had a truly minor kid squabble with an early elementary school friend while playing at her home. I can’t remember the subject. The mother laid into me with a viciousness that exceeded the intensity of the squabble with words I didn’t yet understand. Can’t say I remember that well either. What I remember was the comfort mom gave when I came home in tears. She then verbally laid into my friend’s mom by phone. My friend and I remained friendly. Adult verbal confrontations are inevitably more serious than kid ones. Mom remained protective of me and family members in general for the rest of her life.<hr></p>

                        This was usually a special occasion I associate doing with mom when my grandma was in town. This would include from scratch toll house chocolate chip or ginger snap cookies. I loved liking the leftover bowl…as did my brother Alan. I also remember Grandma’s heavy Passover cake. They talk about the memories of smell. It’s true.<hr>

                    <p><b>COOKING</b><hr>by Enid Cohn (daughter)<hr>
                        Cooking wasn’t a strong suit for mom, though I didn’t notice. I didn’t have a comparison.
                        During her generation, the man worked and the woman tended the home, including cooking, bills, arranging social lives and the kids. Special occasion items that stand out for me were her tzimmes with meatballs, the rare but always requested Swedish meatballs for dad, cheesecake and the never quite tender brisket. As part of her membership in a Jewish woman’s volunteer organization she participated in putting out a Jewish cookbook…for which she included family and friends’ recipes.

                    <p><b>HUGE FLYING PALMETTO BUG </b><hr>by Enid Cohn (daughter) <hr>Our hometown bugs would crawl or stop in their tracks. We freaked out. It was in our motel bathroom the morning we were to leave. Mom instructed me to “Go kill it.” I said, “No, why don’t you kill it?”. We opted to bypass the use of the bathroom and just leave for the restaurant.<hr></p>

                    <p><b>FRIDAY 1/2 DAY WEEKLY HAIR SALON</b><hr>by Enid Cohn (daughter)<hr>
                        The salon was her weekly ritual for female socializing as well hair prep for the weekend …as it was for generations …like for my grandma..until dad had her stop when the easy maintenance wash and dry hair styles took over in the 1970’s. I liked hanging with her, so I would occasionally would tag along. It was never boring. Besides the activity all around, adults happily engaged me, and there were always food items out for the taking.

                    <p><b>MOM CALLED MY BOSS</b><hr>by Alan Cohn (son)<hr>I was in DC, in my junior year at GW (George Washington University), and for some reason I decided to apply to the Marine JAG Corp. I told my Mom that I had taken the tests and passed. I had the papers in front of me to join the Corps. She FREAKED OUT. It was just after Vietnam so everybody was worried about going to war again. Unbeknownst to me, she contacted my boss at the Hill, Christoper, and Philips (the law firm I was working at). He pulled me into his office and sat me down and told me that she contacted him, and he thought I was nuts. He convinced me that my future wasnt in Law but in Business and I'd be making a huge mistake. He and my Mom were right. I finished and passed the BAR, then went on to use the education business.<hr></p>

                        Mom got to initiate feeding our daughter Jessica her first stage 1 meat. Jessi was a great eater as an infant and couldn’t seem to get enough food. She was up to the 95% weight percentile at one point due to a growth spurt with her adorable baby fat rolls to show for it. Jessi made cringing faces eating the stage 1 food because it was so bad. Mom roared in laughter. If Jess didn’t like it, it must have been bad…though she consumed numerous bite fulls. She was hungry. Lol. We didn’t subject her to stage 1 meat after that.<hr></p>

                        I would occasionally join mom as a kid when she visited our neighbor MaryJane Branic for coffee and conversation. MaryJane’s husband would often fish. This time he had a catch of lobsters that she would cook in a large pot. This time she put in too many and the last one crawled out and fell to the floor. Upon seeing this, mom jumped to her feet and immediately stepped from the chair to the on top of her table screaming what MaryJane should do to catch the lobster. MaryJane calmly took a prong, expertly grabbed the lobster and returned the errant lobster to the boiling pot while I looked on amused.<hr></p>

                            I enjoyed occasionally tagging along to watch mom’s duckpin bowling league, unique to Baltimore, which usually lasted a couple hours. She was a good bowler with a funny stance in which she stuck out her bottom before roll. I felt pride when she won or earned a prize…money I believe. I emulated mom by becoming a duckpin bowler when a bowling alley opened in the shopping center near us.

                    <p><b>TENNIS</b><hr>by Enid Cohn (daughter)<hr>
                        I only on occasion attended her regular doubles tennis with ‘the girls’. She took up tennis way after my brother and I learned the game from my dad. My memory is more her super short white tennis dresses with the matching panties and the identifiable sport socks (peds) with the little ball protruding from the back of the tennis shoe. She would stay in the dress all day to do subsequent chores or have lunch with other players. Mom would always attend in subsequent years when I got into competitive tennis tournaments.

                    <p><b>BRIDGE</b><hr>by Enid Cohn (daughter)<hr>
                        This was a staple of mom’s life with ‘the girls’, at the swim/country clubs, or with my dad. The latter would be the occasional social duplicate or the standard Friday night bridge and drinking with the Freinberg’s. The women would play versus the men and the bickering over how the hand was played was part of their weekly ritual while I would be downstairs watching tv.

                    <p><b>PREPPING DINNER</b><hr>by Enid Cohn (daughter)<hr>We were at a time when families ate dinner together at the family table, though up to a couple nights a week Dad might work late. It was 6:15PM dinner time. No tv allowed unless we were watching something special downstairs. I was responsible for setting the table and usually making the salad. Mom always complimented me on my salad making I later learned because she hated doing it. To this day making a big everything in it salad is part of my very limited food prep repertoire.<hr></p>
